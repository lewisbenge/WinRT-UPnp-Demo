WinRT/Windows 8 UPnP/SSDP Library and Sample Project
===============

This project is a following up from a session I presented at Microsoft Australia's Virtual AppFest (http://www.lalaninja.com.au/?p=1243). The code demonstrates the following:

- Creating a multi-cast UDP socket
- Using the UDP socket for SSDP (broadcast) device discovery
- Detecting UPnp devices and retrieving associated metadata. 


TODO:

- Currently this code is in a very early state, and will be fleshed out to include further UPnp method calls and basic DLNA functionality. 

If you required any further information on this library, please reach out to me @LewisBenge or Lewis@LewisBenge.net.
